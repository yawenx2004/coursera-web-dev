			<p>The Hollow Men
				Mistah Kurtz-he dead
							A penny for the Old Guy
				
				
										I
				
					We are the hollow men
					We are the stuffed men
					Leaning together
					Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
					Our dried voices, when
					We whisper together
					Are quiet and meaningless
					As wind in dry grass
					Or rats' feet over broken glass
					In our dry cellar
				   
					Shape without form, shade without colour,
					Paralysed force, gesture without motion;
				   
					Those who have crossed
					With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom
					Remember us-if at all-not as lost
					Violent souls, but only
					As the hollow men
					The stuffed men.
				
				   
											  II
				
					Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
					In death's dream kingdom
					These do not appear:
					There, the eyes are
					Sunlight on a broken column
					There, is a tree swinging
					And voices are
					In the wind's singing
					More distant and more solemn
					Than a fading star.
				   
					Let me be no nearer
					In death's dream kingdom
					Let me also wear
					Such deliberate disguises
					Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves
					In a field
					Behaving as the wind behaves
					No nearer-
				   
					Not that final meeting
					In the twilight kingdom
				
				   
									III
				
					This is the dead land
					This is cactus land
					Here the stone images
					Are raised, here they receive
					The supplication of a dead man's hand
					Under the twinkle of a fading star.
				   
					Is it like this
					In death's other kingdom
					Waking alone
					At the hour when we are
					Trembling with tenderness
					Lips that would kiss
					Form prayers to broken stone.
				
				   
									  IV
				
					The eyes are not here
					There are no eyes here
					In this valley of dying stars
					In this hollow valley
					This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms
				   
					In this last of meeting places
					We grope together
					And avoid speech
					Gathered on this beach of the tumid river
				   
					Sightless, unless
					The eyes reappear
					As the perpetual star
					Multifoliate rose
					Of death's twilight kingdom
					The hope only
					Of empty men.
				
				   
											V
				
					Here we go round the prickly pear
					Prickly pear prickly pear
					Here we go round the prickly pear
					At five o'clock in the morning.
				   
					Between the idea
					And the reality
					Between the motion
					And the act
					Falls the Shadow
													For Thine is the Kingdom
				   
					Between the conception
					And the creation
					Between the emotion
					And the response
					Falls the Shadow
													Life is very long
				   
					Between the desire
					And the spasm
					Between the potency
					And the existence
					Between the essence
					And the descent
					Falls the Shadow
													For Thine is the Kingdom
				   
					For Thine is
					Life is
					For Thine is the
				   
					This is the way the world ends
					This is the way the world ends
					This is the way the world ends
					Not with a bang but a whimper.</p>
